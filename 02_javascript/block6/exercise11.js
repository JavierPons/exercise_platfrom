// Continuing the previous exercise, add the possibility to force the type of the value that can be set on a given property. In this 
// case schema is an object and no longer an array. The allowed values are only "string", "number" and "boolean". If the value of a 
// given property does not have the appropriate type, then the property will not be added to the new object in the db.

// if the argument add is not present then nothing should be added.
